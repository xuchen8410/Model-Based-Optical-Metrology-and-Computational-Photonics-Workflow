# Model-Based-Optical-Metrology-and-Computational-Photonics-Workflow
A reproducible computational photonics toolkit that connects:  Maxwell’s equations → numerical model → validated implementation → structural parameter inference  This project implements a validated 1D RCWA forward solver with automated convergence analysis, parallel parameter sweeps, and measurement-driven inverse fitting.
